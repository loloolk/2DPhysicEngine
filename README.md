# 2 Dimentional Physics Engine

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description:
My attempt at a 2 dimentional physics engine, while also using my math engine. Collision detection (non-constant) is enabled, but collision logic has not been made yet. Rotation is not implemented, so all objects are axis-aligned. The engine is not optimized, and is not intended for use in any serious project. It is simply a learning experience for me.
